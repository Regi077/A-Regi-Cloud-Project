#  event_bus.py  --  RabbitMQ Event Publisher for Delta Analysis Microservice
# =============================================================================
#  Author: Reginald
#  Last updated: 18th June 2025
#
#  DESCRIPTION:
#    - This utility module provides simple functions to publish events
#      (as JSON) to RabbitMQ, so other services or dashboards can react
#      in real time to pipeline state changes.
#    - Used for real-time updates in the overall compliance platform.
#
#  HOW IT WORKS:
#    - get_connection() establishes a connection to RabbitMQ using robust, env-driven credentials.
#      Now includes retry logic to avoid race conditions at startup.
#    - publish_event(topic, payload) sends a durable message to the
#      specified queue/topic, with the payload serialized as JSON.
#    - Always closes the connection after publishing to avoid resource leaks.
