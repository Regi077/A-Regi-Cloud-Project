# The application is set to run in debug mode, which is useful for development.
# In production, it is recommended to set debug to False and use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.      
# The app listens on port 5000, which is the default port for Flask applications.
# The `endpoints` module is where the actual API endpoints are defined, handling requests and responses.

# Perfectâ€”that means your backend API is set up and working exactly as it should!
# You just authenticated and successfully retrieved live data from your secured Flask API. Everything is running smoothly.
