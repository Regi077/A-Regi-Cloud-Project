# Cloud Compliance Tool — Phase 1: Frontend UI (React)

**Author:** Reginald

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the **Frontend UI** for the Cloud Compliance Tool—a modern, dashboard that enables organizations to manage, visualize, and interact with their cloud compliance lifecycle.

**Phase 1** focused on delivering a robust, real-time, and user-friendly React application that integrates seamlessly with all backend compliance microservices. The UI is role-aware, and designed for rapid onboarding of both engineers and compliance teams.

## 🎯 What Was Achieved

- **Role-based Dashboard:**  
  Delivered a fully responsive, role-driven UI that dynamically presents functionality based on user type (Admin, Service Provider, Client).

- **Integrated Compliance Workflows:**  
  Supports framework upload, architecture/IaC validation, automated remediation suggestions, IAM auditing, delta analysis, and live agent status—all accessible via intuitive panels.

- **Real-Time Observability:**  
  Live pipeline/agent status updates powered by Socket.IO, giving instant feedback on the progress of backend compliance pipelines.

- **Onboarding:**  
  All interactions are designed to be frictionless. Detailed in-app labels, error handling, and clear user feedback make this UI accessible even for non-technical stakeholders.

- **Executive-Ready Foundation:**  
  Built with extensibility, auditability, and maintainability at the forefront—ensuring rapid scaling in later phases.

## 🧑‍💻 Technology Stack

- **React 19 + Vite** (Front-end framework, lightning-fast dev/build tooling)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first CSS framework for modern UI)
- **Socket.IO Client** (Real-time pipeline status/notifications)
- **Docker** (Multi-stage build for reproducible deployments)
- **RBAC Logic** (Enforced on the frontend for panel/tab access)
- **ESLint** (Consistent code quality and best practices)
- **Modern JavaScript** (ES2023+, hooks, async/await)
- **Full support for API integrations:** All panels interact with Python/Flask backend microservices
